## Summary
Within this repository, you'll discover various models and computational tools designed for crop monitoring purposes. These resources can be used for predicting the health status of vineyards using images captured by drones.

## Structure
The repository folders are structured as follow: 

- **data:** here you should add the [UC1 GITHUB DATA FOLDER](https://zenodo.org/records/11195994) that you could download from Zenodo.
- **top_view:** it has some top-view level calculations for vegetation analysis.
  - **create_grid**: detects rows and parcels and define a grid
  - **create_grid_aligned**: detects rows and parcels and define a grid after aligned the orthomosaic vineyard image
  - **calculate_vegetation_indexes**: calculates different vegetation indexes of the orthomosaic vineyard image
  - **NDVI_per_parcels**: calculates the NDVI in each parcel
- **models:** models developed for crop monitoring
- **platform.json:** organized information about the models

## Models

The [models](https://github.com/ICAERUS-EU/UC1_Crop_Monitoring/blob/main/models/) developed are the following:
 

#### _[Row-view disease detection model with YOLOv8](https://github.com/ICAERUS-EU/UC1_Crop_Monitoring/blob/main/models/01_plant_disease_detection_yolov8_v1/)_
This model has been trained with YOLOv8 and is able to detect the plants and provide information about its health status from a plant-view level. 

#### _[Plant locator from row-view to global-view](https://github.com/ICAERUS-EU/UC1_Crop_Monitoring/blob/main/models/02_plant_locator_v1/)_
This algorithm contains the complete workflow from detecting a plant in a row-view image to locate this plant in the global-view orthomosaic to visualize its health status at a global scope. It also locates the drone positions.

#### _[Plant locator from row-view to global-view -> grid](https://github.com/ICAERUS-EU/UC1_Crop_Monitoring/blob/main/models/02_plant_locator_v2/)_
This algorithm contains the complete workflow from detecting a plant in a row-view image to locate this plant in the global-view orthomosaic in a grid based visualization to observe its health status at a global scope. It also locates the drone positions.

#### _[Plant leaves analysis](https://github.com/ICAERUS-EU/UC1_Crop_Monitoring/blob/main/models/03_plant_leaves_analysis_v1)_
This code approaches some methods for performing analysis and detect early disease development in vineyard leaves using color detection, VARI index and clustering algorithms.
